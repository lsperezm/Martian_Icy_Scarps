Some irregular pits verge on scallops (or expanded craters) but ill-defined. Small secondary scarps not tabulated separately although they are in a wider depression outside the defined scarp-pit pair. 
South Scarp Site 4,ESP_048894_1245,C,x,-55.1,108.9,S,Possible,Possible,Y,Possible,Two major scarps. Upper surface looks like dust bedforms. Irregular pits verge on scallops. 
South Scarp Site 5,ESP_049198_1225,C,x,-57.2,89.8,SW,N,N,Y,N,Upper surface is either dust bedforms or ill-defined polygons. Scarp has fractures; upper surface has some chains of pits. Dust devil tracks present. Small secondary scarp not tabulated separately.

South Scarp Site 7,ESP_057321_1220,C,x,-57.5,91.9,X,N,N,Y,N,Upper surface has aspects of both dust bedforms and polygons. May be on a slight west-facing slope but minimal.

South Scarp Site 10,ESP_057293_1245,C,x,-55.1,136.9,SE,N,N,Y,N,Multiple en echelon scarp segments. Only tabulated the longest; the others are long for secondary scarps but have essentially similar properties. 
South Scarp Site 11,ESP_057334_1290,CM,x,-50.8,97.3,S,Possible,N,Y,N,"Scarp appears to have much less relief than most others. Many boulders on pit floor. Most of scarp is not relatively-blue but some small patches are and the morphology is classic. Probable small secondary scarp has branched off, not tabulated separately. "

South Scarp Site 13,ESP_057901_1235,CM,x,-56.2,103.1,S,N,N,Y,N,"Relatively-blue exposure is small but enough to consider confirmed; would be considered a small outlier if the main scarp was exposed. Narrow ridges on pit floor, both scarp- and edge-parallel, and triangular patterning suggesting a history of multiple secondary scarps. "
South Scarp Site 14,ESP_057969_1225,CM,x,-57,47.2,X,Possible,Possible,Y,N,"Most of scarp is not relatively-blue (there is coloration suggestive of mafic/sandy material around the scarp) but some small patches are and the morphology is classic. The associated pit is long and narrow and is incised into material that sits below the already-eroded surface of a smooth mantle.  Small secondary scarp exists, not tabulated separately. "
